# Weather Dashboard

## Description

I created a Weather Dashboard that uses the Open Weather Map API to allow the user to search for a city and display the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast for that city.


## Usage

The user can search any city and view the current weather conditions as well as a 5-day forecast. The conditions include temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A search history also appears on the left sidebar after each new search is made.
